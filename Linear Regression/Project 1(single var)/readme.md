This Project is About the basic Implementation of the Simple Linear Regression Model of Machine Learning. This Project is About Predicting the salary of a Canadian Individual using the Dataset available on Kaggle.

    In this project, we initially made a data frame using the pandas library by reading the CSV file.
    Then Plotting all the data points on the graph with the X-axis as year and the Y-axis as per capita
    income Creating a model instance of Linear Regression using the sklearn library, and then
    training or fitting the model with provided data points, and then predicting the per capita income
    of more further years.

Dataset(link to the dataset used): https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ananthu19/canada-per-capita-income-prediction

The following are the Libraries used:) 1.)Pandas 2.)Matplotlib 3.)sklearn
