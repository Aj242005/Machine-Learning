This Project is About the basic Implementation of the Simple Linear Regression Model also known as the Multi-variable Regression Model of Machine Learning. This 
 project is About Predicting house prices using the dataset



 In this project, we initially made a data frame using the pandas library by reading the CSV file. Then
 handling the NuLL and NaN values present in the dataset file. Then Creating a model instance of 
 Multi-variable linear regression then training or fitting the model with provided data points,
 and then predicting the house price which was determined by the various other factors given

The following are the Libraries used:) 1.)Pandas 2.)Matplotlib 3.)sklearn

Thank You.....
